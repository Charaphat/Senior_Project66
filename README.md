# Recurrent neural network for time-series data
### by charaphat
Inside this repo including network (RNN, LSTM, GRU, biLSTM) for training time-series data and inference file.
## How to use
- choose network by define model inside RNN_network.py
- change hyperparameters inside RNN_network.py such as batch size, number of epochs, learning rate and checkpoint epoch
- inference with inference.py
## Tasks!
- adjust traning loss and validation loss figure
- add argument feature to train and infence
- include ANN network in the same file with RNN_network.py
- Seperate classes and functions into utils
- include network data into model state
- inside inference.py shouldn't define any classes or functions
